# MDMS_Admission_Portal
This is a node.js based web application which allows student's to apply for admission in this particular school. 

A student can create a username and password by registering. After that student can fill admission form, upload required documents and pay the admission fee online.
Online payment  is integrated using Paytm Payment Gateway SDK.

A testing version of this web app is deployed on herokuapp. Check it out at https://mdmsonline.herokuapp.com

There is a separate node application for the school's administration office which is only installed on the school's local system from where all the admission requests can be monitored, accepted and rejected. Since there is no need to keep administrative routes on server, I've separated it. Link to administrartive Webapp.
